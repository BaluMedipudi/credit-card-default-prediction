# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to default on their credit card payment
using machine learning techniques.

## Business Objective
To help financial institutions reduce credit risk by identifying high-risk customers early.

## Dataset
Publicly available credit default dataset loaded directly from an online repository.

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (Loan-to-Income Ratio)
- Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Model Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Cross-Validation to assess model robustness

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusion
Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in identifying default-risk customers.
The project demonstrates how machine learning can support credit risk assessment.
